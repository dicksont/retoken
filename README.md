Retoken is a string tokenization library for JavaScript. It provides a Tokenizer class that is based on your standard JavaScript array. This allows us to provide features like:

- **[In-place token extraction & storage](#inplace)**
- **Token retraction** - Token extraction can be undone via retract. State/tokens can be modified & back-tracked.
- **Cross module platform** - Works with browser script tags, AMD loaders, and Node.js modules
- **Compact size** - Single file < 500 lines unminified. Single dependency
