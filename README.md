Retoken is an awesome string tokenizer for JavaScript. Its awesomeness cannot be contained by the following features alone:

- **In-place token extraction & storage** - Tokens are neatly kept in a single array.
- **Token retraction** - Token extraction can be undone via retract. State/tokens can be modified & back-tracked.
- **Cross module platform** - Works with browser script tags, AMD loaders, and Node.js modules
- **Compact size** - Single file < 500 lines unminified. No dependencies.



## Installation
### Node
```javascript
npm install retoken
```
